# Fake News Detector

## Description
A machine learning project to detect fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and API development.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for ensuring code quality.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Fake-News-Detector.git
   cd Fake-News-Detector
